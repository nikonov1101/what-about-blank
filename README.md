What about blank?
=================

This weekend project aims to create an extension for Google Chrome browser, which
replaces blank page which you see when opening a new tab.

The default blank page is quite boring and useless and I wanna to make it a bit useful for me (and maybe for my colleagues and friends).

Things I want to place on a brand new blank page:
- Github's PRs that needs my attention.
- JIRA tasks assigned to me.
- Weather in three cities that I visit periodically.
- Personal tasks from Wunderlist app (unsorted TODOs and shopping list).
- Local time, sunrise and sunset time.

This project contains two parts: a backend and data-collectors written in Python 3.6 (using aiohttp features),
a frontend part is written with Angular (by @instingt, because I can only make weird, spaghetti-driven jQuery code!).
